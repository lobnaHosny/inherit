In pre-Islamic Arabian customary law, the system of inheritance was designed to
keep property within the individual tribe and family. Maternal and uterine
relations were usually excluded.[@skahsmi07, pp. 30--2] The right of succession
depended on whether a person could defend the honour of the family and tribe.
Thus, the property of a deceased Arab devolved on his male agnates capable of
carrying arms.[@jundimeerath, p. 5] Consequently, all females, minors, and
elderly incapable of bearing arms were excluded.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 18;
@jundimeerath, p. 5] Daughters and sisters were excluded because they ceased,
upon their marriage, to be members of their natural (i.e. paternal)
family.[@skahsmi07, pp. 30--2] A person could bequeath all his wealth to one of
his heirs or a stranger.[@abunasr2004, p. 14]

In English law, children and descendants completely excluded ascendants and
collaterals.[@faith1966peasant] Even parents could not succeed simultaneously
with the descendants. Males were preferred to females and the rule of
primogeniture^[The right of succession or inheritance belonging to the
first-born; the principle, custom, or law by which the property or title
descends to the eldest son (or eldest child). (Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd
Ed.)] was recognized.

<!-- In Jewish law, preference is given to the son while the parents and the spouse
are ignored.[@wigoder2002new, pp. 390--1] The wives are considered as property
of the husband and on his death are inherited by the other heirs.[@singer01,
vol. 6, pp. 583--5, under _Inheritance_] Some other laws overemphasized the
right of the spouse.[@singer01, vol. 4, pp. 645--6, under _Dowry_] In
Christianity, biblical texts relating to the laws of inheritance are solely
found in the Old Testament and no related texts are found in the New
Testament.[@catholic02, vol. 7, pp. 463--4] -->

In Jewish law, according to the scriptures, the right to inherit was exclusive
to the sons and the first-born son was favoured by inheriting double the share
of his brothers. Parents and spouses were disregarded and did not fall anywhere
in the order of succession. Later rabbinical laws granted the husband the right
to inherit from his wife but not vice versa. [@wigoder2002new, p. 390--1;
@singer01, vol. 6, pp. 583--5, under _Inheritance_] Furthermore, widows were
considered as part of the property left by their deceased husbands and were
passed on to the heirs through a levirate^[The custom among the Jews and some
other nations, by which the brother or next of kin to a deceased man was bound
under certain circumstances to marry the widow. (Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd
Ed.)] marriage. Some other laws overemphasized the right of the spouse
[@singer01, vol. 6, pp. 583--5, under _Inheritance_ and vol. 4, pp. 645--6 under
_Dowry_]

Although Christianity shares the same biblical laws of inheritance as Judaism,
found in the Old Testament,[@halfmann2002new, vol. 7, pp. 463--4] the Church's
canon law does not take them into consideration. In fact, only very little
concerning inheritance is documented in the canon law. This gives the civil law
precedence in dealing with such matters.[@blackstone62, pp. 36--7]

Islam has laid down a set of equitable principles. These principles entitled
parents, grandparents, daughters, sisters, widows, and many other relatives who
were excluded in pre-Islamic time to inherit. These were added to the category
of heirs who were excluded under customary law mainly based on gender. It also
restricted the testamentary^[Of, pertaining to, or having relation to a
testament or will; of the nature of a will. (Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd
Ed.)] powers of a Muslim to dispose his whole property by way of _waṣīyyah_.

## Indulging in issues of inheritance without knowledge

One of the main objectives of _Sharīʿah_ is to attain peace in society. Hence,
_Sharīʿah_ mitigates and resolves the conflict by granting, and protecting the
rights of individuals and the society collectively. One of those rights that
have to be preserved is the right of the heirs after the death of their relative
(e.g. father, son, and brother). This is an area where injustice is highly
prevalent.[@abunasr2004, pp. 10--1] Therefore, it is only appropriate that
_Sharīʿah_ has set strict laws regarding this matter. Allāh !swt says:

!quran(4_9-10)
(وَلۡيَخۡشَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَوۡ تَرَكُواْ مِنۡ خَلۡفِهِمۡ ذُرِّيَّةٗ ضِعَٰفًا
خَافُواْ عَلَيۡهِمۡ فَلۡيَتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلۡيَقُولُواْ قَوۡلٗا سَدِيدًا ٩
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأۡكُلُونَ أَمۡوَٰلَ ٱلۡيَتَٰمَىٰ ظُلۡمًا إِنَّمَا يَأۡكُلُونَ
فِي بُطُونِهِمۡ نَارٗاۖ وَسَيَصۡلَوۡنَ سَعِيرٗا ١٠)
(And let those (executors and guardians) have the same fear in their minds as
they would have for their own if they had left weak offspring behind. So let
them fear Allāh and speak right words. Verily, those who unjustly eat up the
property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be
burnt in the blazing Fire!)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(9--10))

There are three main places in the Quran where inheritance is expounded on; the
first place is:

!quran(4_11)
(يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَوۡلَٰدِكُمۡۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۚ
فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءٗ فَوۡقَ ٱثۡنَتَيۡنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَۖ وَإِن
كَانَتۡ وَٰحِدَةٗ فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصۡفُۚ وَلِأَبَوَيۡهِ لِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا
ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٞۚ فَإِن لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّهُۥ وَلَدٞ
وَوَرِثَهُۥٓ أَبَوَاهُ فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُۚ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُۥٓ إِخۡوَةٞ
فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصِي بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٍۗ
ءَابَآؤُكُمۡ وَأَبۡنَآؤُكُمۡ لَا تَدۡرُونَ أَيُّهُمۡ أَقۡرَبُ لَكُمۡ نَفۡعٗاۚ
فَرِيضَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا ١١)
(Allāh commands you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a
portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or
more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a
half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left
children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a
third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The
distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have
bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your
children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by
Allāh. And Allāh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

An important point of benefit is that Allāh !swt concludes this _āyah_ by
saying:

!quran(4_11-short)
(...ءَابَآؤُكُمۡ وَأَبۡنَآؤُكُمۡ لَا تَدۡرُونَ أَيُّهُمۡ أَقۡرَبُ لَكُمۡ
نَفۡعٗاۚ فَرِيضَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا ١١)
(...You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are
nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allāh. And Allāh
is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

This means that we should not use our intellect to interfere or have an opinion
in distributing the estate with other than what Allāh !swt has prescribed. And
whoever does so transgresses the limits set by Allāh !swt and treads on a
dangerous path. The _āyah_ also shows that the One Who distributes in that way
is the All-Knowing, He knows all that benefits man which they are unaware of and
do not have the intellect to fathom.

The second place is (from the same _Sūrah_):

!quran(4_12)
(۞وَلَكُمۡ نِصۡفُ مَا تَرَكَ أَزۡوَٰجُكُمۡ إِن لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّهُنَّ وَلَدٞۚ
فَإِن كَانَ لَهُنَّ وَلَدٞ فَلَكُمُ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكۡنَۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ
وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصِينَ بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٖۚ وَلَهُنَّ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكۡتُمۡ إِن
لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّكُمۡ وَلَدٞۚ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمۡ وَلَدٞ فَلَهُنَّ ٱلثُّمُنُ مِمَّا
تَرَكۡتُمۚ مِّنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ تُوصُونَ بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٖۗ وَإِن كَانَ
رَجُلٞ يُورَثُ كَلَٰلَةً أَوِ ٱمۡرَأَةٞ وَلَهُۥٓ أَخٌ أَوۡ أُخۡتٞ فَلِكُلِّ
وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُۚ فَإِن كَانُوٓاْ أَكۡثَرَ مِن ذَٰلِكَ فَهُمۡ
شُرَكَآءُ فِي ٱلثُّلُثِۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصَىٰ بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٍ
غَيۡرَ مُضَآرّٖۚ وَصِيَّةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٞ ١٢)
(In that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no child; but
if they leave a child, you get a fourth of that which they leave after payment
of legacies that they may have bequeathed or debts. In that which you leave,
their (your wives) share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a
child, they get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that
you may have bequeathed or debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in
question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or
a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in
a third, after payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so
that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from Allāh; and Allāh
is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(12))

!quran(4_13)
(تِلۡكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِۚ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ يُدۡخِلۡهُ جَنَّـٰتٖ
تَجۡرِي مِن تَحۡتِهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَاۚ وَذَٰلِكَ ٱلۡفَوۡزُ
ٱلۡعَظِيمُ ١٣)
(These are limits (set by) Allāh (or ordainments as regards laws of
inheritance), and whosoever obeys Allāh and His Messenger (Muḥammad !pbuhb) will
be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein,
and that will be the great success.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(13))

!quran(4_14)
(وَمَن يَعۡصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَيَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَهُۥ يُدۡخِلۡهُ نَارًا
خَٰلِدٗا فِيهَا وَلَهُۥ عَذَابٞ مُّهِينٞ ١٤)
(And whosoever disobeys Allāh and His Messenger (Muḥammad !pbuhb), and
transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and
he shall have a disgraceful torment.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(14))

In the above mentioned _āyah_, there is a stern and clear warning from Allāh
!swt for anyone who transgresses the limits He has set with regard to this
matter. This goes to further emphasize what the previous _āyah_ showed, that the
distribution of inheritance is one of the rights of Allāh !swt. Therefore, no
entity can transgress His law nor alter it even to the lowest degree. In the
last place, which is the last _āyah_ in the same _Sūrah_, Allāh !swt says:

!quran(4_176-short)
(...يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمۡ أَن تَضِلُّواْۗ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيۡءٍ عَلِيمُۢ
١٧٦)
(...(Thus) does Allāh make clear to you (His Law) lest you go astray. And Allāh
the All-Knower of everything.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(176))

The lesson learned is that abandoning the laws of Allāh !swt (especially in the
issue of inheritance) is an act of deviation which leads to going astray, which
usually leads to the punishment of Allāh !swt in the hereafter.

Unfortunately, regardless of the extreme importance and sensitivity of this
issue, the contributions written in English by contemporary scholars in the
field of inheritance leave one wanting. Their number is very low in comparison
to those in Arabic. This knowledge gap is a causative factor in the increasing
number of laymen speaking without knowledge who do not know the statement Allāh
!swt made in the Quran about this evil attitude:

!quran(17_36)
(وَلَا تَقۡفُ مَا لَيۡسَ لَكَ بِهِۦ عِلۡمٌۚ إِنَّ ٱلسَّمۡعَ وَٱلۡبَصَرَ
وَٱلۡفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ كَانَ عَنۡهُ مَسۡ‍ُٔولٗا ٣٦)
(And follow not (O man, i.e. say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which
you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of
each of those one will be questioned (by Allāh).)
(!qlref(Isrāʾ)(17)(36))

In another place, it is mentioned:

!quran(7_33)
(قُلۡ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ ٱلۡفَوَٰحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنۡهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ
وَٱلۡإِثۡمَ وَٱلۡبَغۡيَ بِغَيۡرِ ٱلۡحَقِّ وَأَن تُشۡرِكُواْ بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمۡ
يُنَزِّلۡ بِهِۦ سُلۡطَٰنٗا وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعۡلَمُونَ
٣٣)
(Say (O Muḥammad !pbuhb): “(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden
are _al-Fawāḥish_ (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual
intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds),
unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allāh for which He
has given no authority, and saying things about Allāh of which you have no
knowledge.”)
(!qlref(Aʿrāf)(7)(33))

## The meaning of irth or farāʾiḍ

_Irth_ in all of its derivatives, literally means to transfer
something.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 17] It refers to a situation where a person
survives another in a way that the survivor takes the property of the deceased.
It also means whatever is left by the deceased of properties and rights that
devolves on legal heirs.[@zuhaili12, vol. 9, p. 241]

Technically, _irth_ is defined as a monetary right given to the one who deserves
it after the death of the person who is related to him either through marriage,
or close relationship, or _walāʾ_.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 17; @fsunnah04, pp.
1100--1]

It is also known as _farāʾiḍ_. It is taken from the _āyah_ of the Quran:

!quran(4_11-faridah)
(...فَرِيضَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ...)
(...(these fixed shares) are ordained by Allāh...)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

_Farāʾiḍ_ is the plural of _farīḍah_ which means ordaining or measurement (_taqdīr_) which
in this context means ordained shares.[@zuhaili12, vol. 9, p. 241]

## Authoritative evidence for inheritance

Inheritance is an involuntary devolution of property through which the estate of
a deceased person is transferred to their heirs. Voluntary transfer of property
without consideration during a person's lifetime is called _hibah_. While
voluntary transfer of property without consideration after a person's death is
called will (_waṣīyyah_). Inheritance is an involuntary transfer of property
from the deceased person to his heirs which does not require offer and
acceptance.

The legal basis for the law of inheritance is found in the following _āyah_:

!quran(4_11)
(يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَوۡلَٰدِكُمۡۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۚ
فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءٗ فَوۡقَ ٱثۡنَتَيۡنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَۖ وَإِن
كَانَتۡ وَٰحِدَةٗ فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصۡفُۚ وَلِأَبَوَيۡهِ لِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا
ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٞۚ فَإِن لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّهُۥ وَلَدٞ
وَوَرِثَهُۥٓ أَبَوَاهُ فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُۚ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُۥٓ إِخۡوَةٞ
فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصِي بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٍۗ
ءَابَآؤُكُمۡ وَأَبۡنَآؤُكُمۡ لَا تَدۡرُونَ أَيُّهُمۡ أَقۡرَبُ لَكُمۡ نَفۡعٗاۚ
فَرِيضَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا ١١)
(Allāh commands you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a
portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or
more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a

!quran(4_176)

If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her
inheritance. If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the

## Pillars of inheritance

There are three pillars of the law of inheritance and if one of them is missing
the law will not come into operation. They are:

1. The deceased (_muwarrith_)
2. The heir(s) (_wārith_)
3. The estate of the deceased (_tarikah_ or _mawrūth_)

### Deceased

The right to inheritance in the property of a person is created when he actually
dies (_ḥaqīqī_). In a case where it is unknown whether someone is dead or alive
the court may pass a decree declaring him dead (_ḥukmī_). The right to inherit
the property of a missing person would thus arise only on the day the court
presumed him to have died. His heirs would then be determined on that date and
not on the date on which he disappeared. An apostate is also considered dead by
decree as he cannot inherit.

### Heirs

_Wārith_ (the one who inherits) in Islam refers to anyone who inherits from
among the relatives. The following is the list of all [males]{.smallcaps} who
may inherit:[@fawzan86, pp. 65--7]

<!-- Check if we need a dash -->
<!-- Father's Full Brother, i.e. Full Uncle (FU) -->
<!-- Fathers' Consanguine Brother, i.e. Paternal Uncle (PU) -->

1. Son (S)
2. Son's Son (SS), i.e. Grandson, no matter how much he descends
3. Father (F)
4. Father's Father (FF), i.e. Grandfather, no matter how much he ascends
5. Full Brother (FB)
6. Consanguine Brother (CB)
7. Uterine Brother (UB)
8. Full Brother's Son (FBS)
9. Consanguine Brother's Son (CBS)
10. Father's Full Brother, i.e. Full Uncle (FU)
11. Father's Consanguine Brother, i.e. Paternal Uncle (PU)
12. Father's Full Brother's Son, i.e. Full Uncle's Son (FUS)
13. Father's Consanguine Brother's Son, i.e. Paternal Uncle's Son (PUS)
14. Husband (H)
15. _Muʿtiq_ or _Mawlā_^[The one who gets guardianship of his freed slave.]

Similarly, the following is the list of all [females]{.smallcaps} that may
inherit:[@fawzan86, p. 68]

1. Daughter (D)
2. Son's Daughter (SD) no matter how much she descends through her father
3. Mother (M)
4. Mother's Mother (MM)
5. Father's Mother (FM)
6. Full Sister (FS)
7. Consanguine Sister (CS)
8. Uterine Sister (US)
9. Wife (W)
10. _Muʿtiqah_^[The woman who gives freedom to a slave.]

Scholars have divided eligible heirs into three categories:[@madina23, pp.
18--9]

1. _Uṣūl_ (Roots): these are the father, mother, grandfather, and grandmother no
   matter how far they ascend.

2. _Furūʿ_ (Branches): the son, daughter, son's son and son's daughter, no
   matter how far they descend.

3. _Hawāshī_ (Collaterals): anyone other than those mentioned in _uṣūl_ and
   _furūʿ_.

Furthermore, an heir must survive the deceased or is deemed to have survived the
deceased. A child in the womb of the mother that is born alive later is
considered to have been born on the date of his conception.[@kuwait83, vol. 3,
pp. 65--6]

Therefore, he is treated as in existence upon the death of the person from whom
he inherits. The other heirs may distribute the estate among themselves provided
they reserve the share of the unborn child. It could be the share of one son or
one daughter, whichever is greater.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 67]

A child in the womb is considered a living person provided he is born alive. A
missing person is considered alive by the Shāfiʿīs and can inherit. To the
Ḥanafīs, although he is considered alive, he neither inherits nor is he
inherited from.[@zuhaili12, vol. 9, pp. 411--2]

Those who die together for instance by earthquake, fire, or an air crash, do not
inherit from each other as it could not be established with certainty who died
first. The property would be distributed among the surviving heirs as if the
intermediate heirs who died at the same time had never existed.

### Estate

_Tarikah_ comes from the root word _ta-ra-ka_, which is also the root of
_yatruku_, and _matrūk_, which literally means property left behind. It is a
property that a person leaves behind him after his death. When a Muslim dies, he
may leave behind some properties. The property left behind by a deceased person
is called an estate. An estate comprises the following things: the property
which the deceased owned before his death in the form of tangible property,
debts, and any pecuniary right. Rights may include options,^[These refer to
rights one has after concluding a transaction. For example, the right to return
goods if a deficiency is found.] the right of pre-emption, and the right of
retaliation (_qiṣāṣ_) for murder or injury which also includes the right to ask
for blood money (_diyyah_), the right over the mortgaged property, and usufruct.
The Ḥanafīs, however, do not consider some categories of right and usufruct as
forms of property.[@fsunnah04, p. 1100] Estate also includes those properties
that may not have come to a person's possession until his death.[@madina23, p.
17] For instance a person dies after laying a trap wherein a prey is caught
later. The prey is included in the estate. Similarly, if dividends from shares
in a company come after his death, it is included in the estate.

#### The inclusion or exclusion of rights in the estate

تَرَكَ مَالاً فَلِوَرَثَتِهِ، وَأَنَا وَارِثُ مَنْ لاَ وَارِثَ لَهُ، أَعْقِلُ
لَهُ، وَأَرِثُهُ وَالْخَالُ وَارِثُ مَنْ لاَ وَارِثَ لَهُ، يَعْقِلُ عَنْهُ
وَيَرِثُهُ.»

::: {custom-style="hadith EN"}
Narrated al-Miqdām al-Kindī that the Prophet !pbuh said, «If anyone leaves a
debt or a helpless family, I shall be responsible...»—or the narrator
said—«...Allāh and His Apostle will be responsible but if anyone leaves
property, it goes to his heirs. I am the heir of him who has none, paying
blood-wit for him, and inheriting from him; and a maternal uncle is the heir of
him who has none, paying blood-wit for him, and inheriting from him.»[@dawud97,
no. 2899]
:::

Most scholars follow this _ḥadīth_ and say that rights are included in the
estate. Ḥanafīs argue that the _ḥadīth_ that has reached them does not include
the word _right_.[@kuwait83, vol. 11, pp. 208--9] The view of the majority can
be supported with the statement of the Quran:

!quran(4_11-tarak)
(...فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَۖ...)
(...their share is two-thirds of the inheritance...)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

This statement is general which includes whatever is left by the deceased,
whether it is in the form of money, rights, property, etc.

#### The types of rights

1. Right in rem: This is of 2 types:

    i. Refers to the right of ownership.
    ii. Rights which are not property but are dependent on or subservient to
    property. For instance, the right of way, the right of the passage of water,
    the right to climb the stairs, the right of option of defect, option of
    selection which are not inheritable according to the Ḥanafīs as
    well.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, pp. 65--6]

2. Right in Personam: It is the right which concerns merely the person of an
   individual and wherein no element of property is involved. The majority
   includes them while the Ḥanafīs do not.[@zuhaili12, vol. 9, pp. 268--9]

#### Conditions

1. The property left should be property in the eyes of the _Sharīʿah_.

2. Usurped or stolen property or a property that the deceased has acquired
   through cheating or other dishonest means are not included in the estate of
   the deceased as he is not regarded by the _Sharīʿah_ as the rightful owner of
   the property. The deceased will be responsible to Allāh !swt for acquiring
   the property illegally and the heirs are also committing sin for distributing
   property among themselves when it belongs to others. If the real owner is
   known the property should be returned to them otherwise it should be given as
   charity.

3. If a property of the deceased is mortgaged it should be first released and
   then distributed among the heirs. If a deceased person did not leave behind
   other properties which can be used to release the mortgaged property, then it
   should not be included in the estate. It should be sold and after the
   mortgagee's debt is satisfied then the balance, if any, should be included in
   the estate.

4. The pension and gratuity of the deceased is included in the estate.

5. Compensation: given by an employer to the family of the employee for the
   death of the employee who dies in the course of duty, or compensation given
   to the family of a dead person who died in a plane crash due to the
   negligence of the airline, or compensation given by a person killed by a
   negligent and careless driver may be included in the estate or may be
   distributed among the heirs based on the law of the _diyāt_ in _Islam_.

## Causes of inheritance

The right to inheritance arises from one of the following four causes:

1. Relationship by blood. This can be classified into sharers (_aṣḥāb
   al-furūḍ_), residuary heirs (_ʿaṣabah_), and distant kindred (_dhawī
   al-arḥām_). Relationship by adoption does not entitle a person to
   inheritance.

2. Relationship by a valid marriage. Only a husband and wife inherit from each
   other in case one of them survives the other. In-laws are not entitled.

3. _Walāʾ_ (the right to guardianship of one's freed slave).

4. _Bayt al-māl_. In the case of those who have no heir or any of the above
   three causes.


## Preclusion from inheritance

Certain factors preclude a person from inheriting. Three (3) such factors are
agreed upon by scholars: difference in religion, murder, and slavery. In
addition to explicit evidences from the Sunnah, these factors were also
extracted by scholars from the Book of Allāh !swt. What follows is a brief
explanation and details of extraction from the Quran by scholars.

[Difference in religion]{.smallcaps}. People of different religions do not
inherit from each other. For example, a Muslim husband does not inherit from his
deceased Christian wife and vice versa.

Narrated Usāmah bin Zayd !p[him] who said during the Conquest (of Makkah), “O
Messenger of Allāh! Where will we encamp tomorrow?” The Prophet !pbuh said, «But
has ʿAqīl left for us any house to lodge in?» He !pbuh then added, «No believer
will inherit a _kāfir's_ property, and no _kāfir_ will inherit the property of a
believer.» Al-Zuhrī was asked, “Who inherited Abū Ṭālib?” Al-Zuhrī replied,
“ʿAqīl and Ṭālib inherited him.” Maʿmar transmits from al-Zuhrī, “Where will we
encamp tomorrow?” He said this during the farewell Ḥajj. However, Yūnus does not
mention the farewell Ḥajj nor the Conquest of Makkah.[@buk00, nos. 4282--3]
:::

From the Quran, this is inferred from the following _āyah_:

!quran(8_75-short2)
(...وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡأَرۡحَامِ بَعۡضُهُمۡ أَوۡلَىٰ بِبَعۡضٖ فِي كِتَٰبِ
ٱللَّهِۚ...)
(...But kindred by blood are nearer to one another (regarding inheritance) in
the decree ordained by Allāh...)
(!qlref(Anfāl)(8)(75))

Apparently, this _āyah_ seems to contradict the aforementioned _ḥadīth_.
However, this is not the case since the Quran has established that the rights of
Muslims between themselves are far greater than those between them and the
_kuffār_. Ties of religion precede blood ties. When a Muslim dies, his rights
will automatically be transferred to those who are closer to him, i.e. the
Muslims. In this regard, Ibn al-Qayyim has said:

> Pay attention to this deep meaning contained in the _āyah_ of _mawārīth_
> (inheritance); Allāh !swt based the inheritance of the spouse upon a legal
> marital relation, He used the word _al-Zawjah_ (wife) instead of using the
> word _al-Marʾah_ (woman). This is obvious from the following _āyah_,
> [﴾وَلَكُمۡ نِصۡفُ مَا تَرَكَ أَزۡوَٰجُكُمۡ﴿]{custom-style="quran inline AR"}
> (In that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no
> child...) [al-Nisāʾ, Q4:12]. This is a clear indication that the basis of
> inheritance among the spouses is nothing but the fact of marital relationship
> which makes both spouses to be compatible to each other and look alike,
> whereas this type of tie does not exist in the case of a Muslim and a _kāfir_,
> there is no compatibility, similarity, and appropriation between a Muslim and
> a _kāfir_. Thus, there cannot be inheritance between them. The amazing secrets
> of the Quran are always beyond the comprehension of the creation.”[@jala97, p.
> 347]

[Murder]{.smallcaps}. A person who causes the death of another, who he would
normally inherit from, is precluded from inheritance. All _madhabs_ agree that
if the death of the victim was caused by deliberate, _premeditated action_, the
murderer cannot inherit from the victim. The evidence for this is the following
narration:

:::{custom-style="hadith in-list AR"}
عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ ﷺ قَالَ ‏«الْقَاتِلُ لاَ يَرِثُ.»
:::

:::{custom-style="hadith in-list EN"}
Narrated Abū Hurayrah !p[him] that the Prophet !pbuh said, «The murderer will
not inherit.»[@majah14, no. 2744]
:::

Therefore, intentional (_ʿamd_) or quasi-intentional (_shibh al-ʿamd_) murder
precludes the culprit from inheriting. The Shāfiʿīs ruled that any involvement
in the resulting death deprives the involved person from inheritance, regardless
of his intention.[@madina23, p. 25] They did not exempt anyone from this ruling
except a _rāwī_ (narrator) and a _muftī_ (the one who gives _fatwā_ in that
court case).!ref The Mālikīs and Ḥanafīs, on the other hand, allow a person to
inherit from the deceased if the death was unintentional.!ref This preclusion is
also inferred from the saying of Allāh !swt:

!quran(4_11-short3)
(...ءَابَآؤُكُمۡ وَأَبۡنَآؤُكُمۡ لَا تَدۡرُونَ أَيُّهُمۡ أَقۡرَبُ لَكُمۡ
نَفۡعٗاۚ...)
(...You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are
nearest to you in benefit...)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

Obviously, the murderer did not seek to benefit the deceased; he brought great
harm by killing him. Due to his evil illegal act, the murderer loses the quality
that would have enabled him to inherit, i.e. the familial bond. According to the
law of inheritance such ties have to exist for a person to be entitled to
inheritance. The Quran says:

!quran(8_75-short2)
(...وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡأَرۡحَامِ بَعۡضُهُمۡ أَوۡلَىٰ بِبَعۡضٖ فِي كِتَٰبِ
ٱللَّهِۚ...)
(...But kindred by blood are nearer to one another (regarding inheritance) in
the decree ordained by Allāh...)
(!qlref(Anfāl)(8)(75))

This _āyah_ shows that familial ties have to be strong to enable a person to
inherit. This is why scholars say that murder is the greatest cause of
inheritance preclusion.

[Slavery]{.smallcaps}. Slaves do not have estates that can be inherited since
everything a slave earns belongs to the master.[@madina23, p. 24] Although
slavery is not practiced today, the _Sharīʿah_ rulings are unchanged. When a
slave dies, he cannot be inherited from because he doesn't have an estate. The
master is the true owner of slave's person and everything he owned.

!quran(4_11-short2)
(يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَوۡلَٰدِكُمۡۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ
ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۚ...)
(Allāh commands you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a
portion equal to that of two females...)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

The Quran allocated specific portions of the estate to the heirs as long as they
have the ability to own. However, this is not possible in the case of a slave.
This is because giving a share of the estate means giving the master since it is
already established that whatever property or wealth a slave acquires belongs to
his master, and the master is not an heir to the deceased.

If a slave is to be inherited from by any of his heirs, that heir will be
inheriting what does not belong to the deceased and this is wrong according to
the Sharīʿah. Thus, it can be concluded that a slave does not inherit according
to the Quran due to the lack of the ability to own and the Quran only granted
inheritance to those who possess the ability to own.[@saadi02, Q8:75, p. 373]

---

There are other depriving factors mentioned by some scholars. These include
apostasy, _liʿān_,[^lian] _zinā_, _Dār al-Ḥarb_, etc... However careful
observation shows that all of these are either included in the aforementioned
factors or they do not arise at all. Apostasy is a form of disbelief which
should be categorized under difference of religion, and this is exactly what the
Ḥanbalīs, Shāfiʿīs, and Mālikīs stated.[@zuhaili12, vol. 9, p. 264] As for
_liʿān_, it is of two types: (1) based on the rejection of a child's paternity
and (2) based on the accusation of _zinā_ against the wife. The second type of
_liʿān_ does not prevent both from inheriting each other because lineage is
established. As for the first type, there is no cause for inheritance between
them. This is because an illegitimate child is not attributed to the biological
father according to the Sharīʿah, and thus the case does not even arise. This is
what should be said with regard to _zinā_ being a preventer. With regard to the
person in _Dār al-Ḥarb_, he is either a Muslim or not. If he is a Muslim, he has
an absolute right to inherit from his Muslim relative if he dies. If he is not a
Muslim, then being in _Dār al-Ḥarb_ did not prevent him from inheritance;
difference in religion did. Allāh !swt knows best.

[^lian]: The Arabic word, _liʿān_, is derived from the infinitive _laʿn_. It
means preventing and excluding from goodness. Being cursed by Allāh !swt means
preventing or excluding [mankind] of His Mercy. Whereas being cursed by the
creation means invoking curses and calling each other names. _Liʿān_ is a shared
act between two parties as in fights and disputations. A _qāḍī_ performs _liʿān_
between a married couple when he rules that they should resort to _liʿān_
according to the legal way.

    Legally, _liʿān_ has many definitions according to scholars. These
    include:

    1. Specific words used by a husband forced to defame his wife who blemishes
       his honour or to deny paternity of a child.

    2. Testimonies affirmed by oaths by a married couple. This consists of
       cursing by the husband and supplication for inflicting wrath by the wife
       which stands equal to the punishment of defamation on the part of the
       husband and the punishment of adultery on the part of the wife.
       (@bandar08, pp. 132--3)


## Deduction from the estate

Upon the death of a person there are four rights attached to his estate and
there is a specific order to follow in settling them. These include the funeral
expenses of the deceased person, his debts, his _waṣīyyah_ and the shares of his
heirs over the estate. _Waṣīyyah_ was discussed in a previous chapter. The
shares of his heirs are discussed in the following section. The first two rights
are briefly explained as follows.[For more details, see @zuhaili12, vol. 9, pp.
269--75]

[Funeral expenses]{.smallcaps}. Priority in the estate of the deceased person
goes to his funeral expenses and burial. They should be performed in a moderate
way avoiding extravagance and deficiencies.

[Settlement of debts]{.smallcaps}. The settlement of debts begins after the
payment of the funeral expenses. The importance of the settlement of debt in
Islam can be understood by referring to the Quran and the traditions of the
Prophet !pbuh. The emphasis that the Prophet !pbuh attached to the repayment of
loans is understood from the fact that he would refuse to pray over those who
died in debt without leaving any means for paying it until their creditors'
claims were provided for or he himself would arrange its repayment before
performing the prayer.

:::

Debts should be settled in the following order:[@zuhaili12, vol. 9, pp. 270--3]

1. All _madhabs_ agree that funeral expenses take priority over debts payable
   from the estate. However, they differ over debts that are in the form of
   property. These include: the right of the pledgee over a property which the
   deceased pledged before his death, unpaid price of the goods which the
   deceased bought before his death, or undelivered goods which the deceased
   sold before his death. The Ḥanafīs, Shāfʿīs, and Mālikīs are of the opinion
   that claims over the property take precedence over funeral expenses. The
   Ḥanbalīs, on the other hand, observe that funeral expenses take precedence
   over all other claims. The last opinion might be the most applicable because
   in the case of a bankrupt person, his assets are sold to pay off his debts
   except what is necessary for his survival. This is done even though he has
   the physical ability to seek necessary provisions unlike when he is dead and
   completely helpless. Therefore, it is more fitting that the same is more
   applied here; that the funeral expenses should be settled first because these
   are necessary and he is unable to help himself.

2. Debts owed to Allāh !swt. They include unperformed _Ḥajj_, unpaid _zakāh_,
   atonement for a broken oath (_kaffārah_), _nadhr_, and missed obligatory
   fasting that was a result of _nadhr_. To the Ḥanafīs, these are abolished
   with the death of the person. They argue that debts -- the payment of which
   is an obligation -- are debts that concern the right of the people (_Ḥaqq
   al-Nās_). The heirs are not obliged to settle claims concerning the rights of
   Allāh !swt except when the deceased has made a will that these should be
   settled from his estate. In this case they are settled from !frac(1)(3) of
   the estate. According to most _madhabs_, these debts should be fulfilled from
   the estate even if no will is made. They argue that these are equally binding
   obligations on the deceased. The Shāfʿīs give priority to the settlement of
   these debts over debts owed to the people. The following _ḥadīth_ is used as
   evidence:

   :::{custom-style="hadith in-list AR"}
   عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ قَالَ: جَاءَ رَجُلٌ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ ﷺ فَقَالَ يَا رَسُولَ
   اللَّهِ، إِنَّ أُمِّي مَاتَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا صَوْمُ شَهْرٍ، أَفَأَقْضِيهِ عَنْهَا؟
   قَالَ «‏نَعَمْ، فَدَيْنُ اللَّهِ أَحَقُّ أَنْ يُقْضَى.‏‏»
   :::

   :::{custom-style="hadith in-list EN"}
   Narrated Ibn ʿAbbās !p[themtwo]: A man came to the Prophet !pbuh and said, “O
   Allāh's Apostle! My mother died and she ought to have fasted one month (for
   her missed Ramaḍān). Shall I fast on her behalf?” The Prophet !pbuh replied
   in the affirmative and said, «Allāh's debts have more right to be
   paid.»[@buk00, no. 1953]
   :::

3. The third category is debts incurred by the deceased whether he was healthy
   or suffering from the death illness. They may include loans, dowry, or
   payment in return for a service, provided there is evidence.

4. Lastly, the debts acknowledged during the death illness. These are considered
   the weakest claims on the estate. They may in reality be gifts and are,
   therefore, subject to the rule of _waṣīyyah_. Such an acknowledgement however
   is not acceptable if it is in favour of one heir, unless other heirs consent.

   Debts are first discharged with cash derived from claims owed to the deceased,
   then from cash in hand, then from the proceeds of the sale of movable property,
   and if it is not sufficient then lastly from the proceeds of the sale of
   immovable property of the estate. In the case where the debts are equal to or
   exceed the estate then the estate is distributed among the creditors in
   proportion to their claims. The heirs may settle all the debts and thereby free
   the estate and acquire it for themselves. The creditors cannot object to such
   settlements. The creditors have the right to nullify any transaction such as
   sale, purchase, or gift, which were concluded by the deceased during his death
   illness if such transactions affect the payment of debt. However, the heirs are
   not personally liable for the debts. Thus, if the deceased left no assets, the
   debts would remain unredeemed; and if he left insufficient assets, the payment
   would be limited to the amount of the assets.

[Bequests]{.smallcaps}. The next priority goes to the payment of his legacy out
of a !frac(1)(3) of what remains after his debts are paid. After payment of
debts and legacies the heirs may nullify any unfair transaction which may affect
their prescribed shares. Disadvantageous transactions to the heirs may include
_waqf_, gifts, and sale for a lesser price than the value of the property that
are made during the death illness and therefore subject to nullification or
approval by the heirs should they exceed the prescribed one third.

[Estate devolvement]{.smallcaps}. Lastly the residue is distributed among his
successors according to the Islamic law of inheritance (_farāʾiḍ_).

## Devolving estate to heirs

All _madhabs_ agree that the estate devolves on the heir immediately after the
death if there is no debt or _waṣīyyah_ involved. They also agree that the
remainder of the estate after the payment of debts and fulfilment of _waṣīyyah_
stands transferred to the heirs. However, they differ on whether a part of the
estate covered by the debt is transferred to the heirs or not. The Ḥanafīs argue
that a part of the estate which is equal to the value of the debt is not
included in the property of the heirs. The heirs are entitled to take only the
residue left after the payment of debts and the will (_waṣīyyah_). If the whole
estate is covered by debt, the heirs will own nothing.[@kuwait83, vol. 11, pp.
212--3] They, however, have the right to free the estate from the creditors by
paying them their claims on the estate.!ref

According to the Shāfiʿīs and Ḥanbalīs, the property of the deceased Muslim
vests in his heirs immediately after his death. The property, however, is
received by each heir subject to his proportionate share of the debt.[@kuwait83,
vol. 11, pp. 212--3] The heirs become the owner of the indebted property
irrespective of whether the debt covers the whole of the estate or a part of it.
However, the debt will relate to the whole estate and the estate will be liable
for it. The heirs hold it subject to the payment of debts in proportion to their
share in the estate, and also subject to the payment of _waṣīyyah_, if any, up
to the bequeathed one-third. Accordingly, the debts do not suspend the right of
the heirs to distribute the estate at any time. It is not incumbent upon them to
postpone the distribution of the estate until the debts are paid. However, each
heir is liable for the debt of the deceased in proportion to his share, even
after the distribution of the estate, but no more. Consequently, if an heir dies
after the death of the deceased but before the distribution of the estate, his
share descends on his own heirs and does not laps to the general estate.!ref

In situations where the estate of the deceased has not been distributed among
the heirs, a creditor can execute a decree against the entire estate,
irrespective of the extent of the liability of each heir. He may satisfy his
claim out of the said property in priority to the creditors of any of the heirs.
A creditor of the deceased may also sue the executor or the administrator, and
if none, the heir or heirs of the deceased for the recovery of his debts. He has
the option to sue one or more of the heirs. However, if he chooses to sue one or
some of the heirs but not all, then only such an heir or heirs are liable to
discharge the debt proportionate to his share in the whole property. It is
because one heir has no right to deal with the shares of other heirs. The debts
of the deceased are given priority over the personal debts of the heirs.

### Quranic heirs (aṣḥāb al-furūḍ)

This group comprises twelve persons whose shares are specified in the Quran.
They are also called Quranic heirs or sharers. They are:

**Spouses:** Husband and wife.

**Descendants:** Daughter, son's daughter (no matter how much she descends through the male children).

**Ascendants:** Father, mother, father's father, and grandmothers (from both father and mother).

**Collaterals:** Full sister, consanguine sister, uterine sisters, and uterine
brother.

#### Spouses

The surviving spouse is a primary heir and, therefore, always inherits. The
Quran specifically provides their entitlements in the following _āyah_:

!quran(4_12)
(۞وَلَكُمۡ نِصۡفُ مَا تَرَكَ أَزۡوَٰجُكُمۡ إِن لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّهُنَّ وَلَدٞۚ
فَإِن كَانَ لَهُنَّ وَلَدٞ فَلَكُمُ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكۡنَۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ
وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصِينَ بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٖۚ وَلَهُنَّ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكۡتُمۡ إِن
لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّكُمۡ وَلَدٞۚ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمۡ وَلَدٞ فَلَهُنَّ ٱلثُّمُنُ مِمَّا
تَرَكۡتُمۚ مِّنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ تُوصُونَ بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٖۗ وَإِن كَانَ
رَجُلٞ يُورَثُ كَلَٰلَةً أَوِ ٱمۡرَأَةٞ وَلَهُۥٓ أَخٌ أَوۡ أُخۡتٞ فَلِكُلِّ
وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُۚ فَإِن كَانُوٓاْ أَكۡثَرَ مِن ذَٰلِكَ فَهُمۡ
شُرَكَآءُ فِي ٱلثُّلُثِۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصَىٰ بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٍ
غَيۡرَ مُضَآرّٖۚ وَصِيَّةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٞ ١٢)
(In that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no child; but
if they leave a child, you get a fourth of that which they leave after payment
of legacies that they may have bequeathed or debts. In that which you leave,
their (your wives) share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a
child, they get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that
you may have bequeathed or debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in
question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or
a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in
a third, after payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so
that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from Allāh; and Allāh
is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(12))

A husband is entitled to a share of !frac(1)(2) of the property of his deceased
wife provided that the deceased spouse does not leave behind any child or any
other agnatic descendants such as a son or a daughter of a son whether from the
claimant husband or from any previous husband. In the presence of a child the
husband gets !frac(1)(4) from the net property of the deceased wife.

The widow is entitled to a !frac(1)(4) share from the property of her deceased
husband provided that the deceased does not leave behind any child or their
descendants whether from the claimant wife or any other wife. In the presence of
a child the widow gets !frac(1)(8) from the net property of her deceased
husband. If there is more than one widow, they divide the share (whether
!frac(1)(4) or !frac(1)(8)) among themselves equally. There is no difference
between a childless widow and a widow that has children.

#### Ascendants (usūl)

The Quran assigns !frac(1)(6) to the father as his share if the deceased has a
son. In the absence of the father the grandfather substitutes him. A father may
inherit both as a sharer and residuary heir in the presence of only female
agnatic descendants of his deceased son or daughter, for instance, when the
deceased leaves behind a daughter. The father may inherit as a residuary heir
when there is no agnatic male or female descendant, e.g. son or daughters.

A mother is allotted !frac(1)(3) if the deceased has left no child, or agnatic
descendants, or more than one brother or sister of any description (full,
consanguine, or uterine). Otherwise she would receive !frac(1)(6) of the estate
of her deceased child. A grandmother is a substitute for the mother and is
entitled to inherit only in her absence. The Quran says about the inheritance of
_Usūl_:

!quran(4_11-short4)
(يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَوۡلَٰدِكُمۡۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۚ
فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءٗ فَوۡقَ ٱثۡنَتَيۡنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَۖ وَإِن
كَانَتۡ وَٰحِدَةٗ فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصۡفُۚ وَلِأَبَوَيۡهِ لِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا

فَرِيضَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا ١١)
(For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left
children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a
third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The
distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have
bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your
children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by
Allāh. And Allāh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

!quran(4_11-parents)
(...وَلِأَبَوَيۡهِ لِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ

ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا ١١)
(...For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left
children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a

Allāh. And Allāh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

##### Grandfather

A grandfather i.e. father's father can only inherit when the father is dead (or
excluded with _waṣf_). He inherits as follows:

1. If the deceased is survived by a son, the grandfather receives !frac(1)(6) as a
   Quranic sharer.

2. If the deceased is survived by a daughter, the grandfather gets !frac(1)(6) and
   is also entitled to receive the balance if there is any as a residuary heir.

3. If the deceased has no male or female child, the grandfather becomes a
   residuary heir (_ʿaṣabah_).

4. If the deceased is survived only by a grandfather and a grandmother and no
   other heir exists, the grandmother gets !frac(1)(6) and the grandfather
   becomes a residuary heir (_ʿaṣabah_), provided that both are of the same degree. A
   grandfather of a closer degree excludes a more remote paternal grandmother
   according to the view of the majority. This is based on the maxim:

   ::: {custom-style="athar AR"}
   كلُّ مَنْ أَدْلَى بِواسِطَةٍ حَجَبَتْهُ تِلْكَ الوَاسِطَةُ
   :::

   ::: {custom-style=""}
   A person who is related to the deceased through another is excluded by the
   presence of the latter.
   :::

   However, the Ḥanbalīs did not agree with this type of exclusion based on the
   fact that the grandmother is inheriting the portion of the mother not the
   father, and this is the sounder view. According to them, she is an
   exception to that maxim which is similar to the issue of uterine siblings
   inheriting in the presence of the mother.[@madina23, p. 52]

**Note:**

It is a consensus of the scholars that grandfather (father's father) substitutes
a father except in the following five situations.

<!-- TODO Check the reference of point one -->
<!-- TRELLO: Task 15 -->

1. In the presence of a father, the father's mother cannot inherit according to
   the view of the majority.[@madina23, p. 73] However if the father is dead and
   a grandfather substitutes him, he cannot exclude the father's mother, i.e.
   the grandfather's wife.

2. The case of _al-Gharrāwayn_, where the deceased is survived by the father,
   mother and the husband. In this case the mother takes !frac(1)(3) of the
   balance after the share of the husband is given, and the father becomes a
   residuary heir (_ʿaṣabah_). However, if the deceased is survived by a mother
   and a grandfather, the mother receives !frac(1)(3) of the whole estate and
   the grandfather receives the balance.

3. The other case of _al-Gharrāwayn_ is where the deceased is survived by the
   father, mother, and a wife. In this case the mother takes !frac(1)(3) of the
   balance after the share of the wife is given, and the father becomes a
   residuary heir (_ʿaṣabah_). However, if the deceased is survived by the
   mother and the grandfather then the mother receives !frac(1)(3) of the whole
   estate and the grandfather receives the balance.

4. The case of inheritance with _walāʾ_. In the case of _walāʾ_, the father
   excludes all of the siblings and their descendants by the consensus of all
   scholars.!ref However, according to Imāms Mālik and al-Shāfiʿī, the
   grandfather does not replace the father in this regard, instead he will be
   excluded by the siblings of the _muʿtiq_.[@madina23, p. 186]

5. A father excludes all of the deceased's siblings, i.e. full, consanguine, and
   uterine brothers and sisters. However, according to Imām Abū Ḥanīfah, Imām
   Aḥmad in one of his opinions, a number of Ḥanbalī scholars, and the Shāfiʿīs,
   the grandfather also excludes full, consanguine, and uterine siblings of the
   deceased since a grandfather substitutes the father.[@madina23, pp. 186--7]
   In contrast, most _madhabs_ and Imāms Abū Yūsuf and Muḥammad of the Ḥanafīs,
   are of the opinion that a grandfather cannot exclude full and consanguine
   siblings of the deceased, instead, they shall inherit with him.[@madina23,
   pp. 187; @mughni97, vol. 9, pp. 66] However, in any such cases, the share of
   the grandfather should not be less than !frac(1)(6) of the estate.[@mughni97,
   vol. 9, p. 68] All _madhabs_ agree that the grandfather excludes uterine
   siblings.[@madina23, pp. 186; @mughni97, vol. 9, p. 65]

##### Grandmother

<!-- TODO Double check the references here -->
<!-- TRELLO: Task 17 -->

A grandmother, whether a mother's mother or a father's mother can only inherit
when the mother is dead. In the presence of a mother both paternal and maternal
grandmothers cannot inherit. According to the view of the majority a paternal
grandmother is also excluded by the father.[@madina23, p. 73] A father cannot
exclude the maternal grandmother. However, the Ḥanbalīs do not agree with this
opinion. According to them, the grandmother is only excluded by the
mother.[@madina23, p. 73] If a deceased is survived by two grandmothers, both of
them receive !frac(1)(6) of the estate which they have to share equally. It
should be stated here that great grandmothers also can inherit as long as the
chain between them and the deceased is not interrupted. A paternal great
grandmother is the one who is connected with the deceased through males only,
i.e. a mother of a father's father and so on. Similarly, a great maternal
grandmother is the one who is connected with the deceased through females only,
i.e. a mother of a mother's mother and so on. However, in a case where all of
them are alive, then the grandmothers will exclude the great grandmothers.

#### Children (descendants)

These two could be grouped in the daughters' class. For a single daughter the
Quran fixes !frac(1)(2) while for more than one daughter !frac(2)(3) is allotted
in the estate of the deceased parent. The Quran declares:

!quran(4_11)
(يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَوۡلَٰدِكُمۡۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۚ
فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءٗ فَوۡقَ ٱثۡنَتَيۡنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَۖ وَإِن
كَانَتۡ وَٰحِدَةٗ فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصۡفُۚ وَلِأَبَوَيۡهِ لِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا
ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٞۚ فَإِن لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّهُۥ وَلَدٞ
وَوَرِثَهُۥٓ أَبَوَاهُ فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُۚ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُۥٓ إِخۡوَةٞ
فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصِي بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٍۗ
ءَابَآؤُكُمۡ وَأَبۡنَآؤُكُمۡ لَا تَدۡرُونَ أَيُّهُمۡ أَقۡرَبُ لَكُمۡ نَفۡعٗاۚ
فَرِيضَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا ١١)
(Allāh commands you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a
portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or
more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a
half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left
children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a
third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The
distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have
bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your
children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by
Allāh. And Allāh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

If the claimants are more than one and are of equal degree they divide equally
the !frac(2)(3) quota among themselves. However, if they are not equal in degree
then the superior daughters are first given their shares from the !frac(2)(3)
quota which is !frac(1)(2) of the estate and the residue of the !frac(2)(3)
which is !frac(1)(6) of the estate is given to the daughters of inferior
category. For example, if a person dies leaving behind a husband, a daughter,
and a son's daughter. The husband gets !frac(1)(4) while the two daughters are
assigned !frac(2)(3). However, out of this !frac(2)(3) the superior daughter
gets the fixed portion given to her by the Quran which is !frac(1)(2). The
remainder of the !frac(1)(6) goes to the inferior.

Although a daughter is a Quranic heir, she becomes a residuary heir (_ʿaṣabah_)
when she is accompanied by a son or son's son of equal degree. For example, when
a daughter is accompanied with a son or a son's daughter is accompanied with a
son's son. In this situation, the daughter gets half of what a son is entitled
to. This is based on the statement of the Quran:

!quran(4_11-short2)
(يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَوۡلَٰدِكُمۡۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ
ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۚ...)
(Allāh commands you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male, a
portion equal to that of two females...)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(11))

#### Collaterals

Among collaterals, full and consanguine sisters and uterine siblings are Quranic
heirs. Male descendants and ascendants of the deceased exclude brothers, sisters
and all other collaterals. Consanguine brothers and sisters are also excluded by
full brothers. But uterine siblings are not excluded by either full or
consanguine brothers and/or sisters. They inherit with them simultaneously.

!quran(4_12-short)
(...وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٞ يُورَثُ كَلَٰلَةً أَوِ ٱمۡرَأَةٞ وَلَهُۥٓ أَخٌ أَوۡ
أُخۡتٞ فَلِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُۚ فَإِن كَانُوٓاْ أَكۡثَرَ مِن
ذَٰلِكَ فَهُمۡ شُرَكَآءُ فِي ٱلثُّلُثِۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصَىٰ بِهَآ
أَوۡ دَيۡنٍ غَيۡرَ مُضَآرّٖۚ وَصِيَّةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٞ
١٢)
(...If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither
ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the
two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third, after payment of
legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is caused (to
anyone). This is a Commandment from Allāh; and Allāh is Ever All-Knowing,
Most-Forbearing.)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(12))

If there is only one full or consanguine sister she is entitled to !frac(1)(2)
while a group of more than one sister of the said nature would be allotted
!frac(2)(3) in the estate of the deceased. A sister like daughters becomes a
residuary heir in the presence of her equal male counterparts such as a full
sister in the presence of a full brother and a consanguine sister in the
presence of consanguine brothers.

!quran(4_176)
(يَسۡتَفۡتُونَكَ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفۡتِيكُمۡ فِي ٱلۡكَلَٰلَةِۚ إِنِ ٱمۡرُؤٌاْ

فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۗ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمۡ أَن

(They ask you for a legal verdict. Say, “Allāh directs (thus) about _al-Kalālah_
(those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs). If it is a man
that dies leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have half the inheritance.
If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her
inheritance. If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the
inheritance; if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the
share of the female. (Thus) does Allāh make clear to you (His Law) lest you go
astray. And Allāh is the All-Knower of everything.”)
(!qlref(Nisāʾ)(4)(176))

Full and consanguine sisters, like daughters and son's daughters, are classed
together. The position of the full sister vis-à-vis consanguine sister is the
same as that of a daughter vis-à-vis son's daughter. Thus, like a daughter, a
full sister gets preference over a consanguine sister. A full sister is treated
like a daughter while a consanguine sister is treated like a son's daughter. A
full brother (like a son) makes a full sister (like a daughter) a residuary heir
along with him and completely excludes a consanguine brother and a consanguine
sister, if any, in the same manner as a son or a higher son completely excludes
son's children or a lower son's children. As sharers, the daughter's class has
precedence over the sister's class. Therefore, in situations where the daughters
or granddaughters are not accompanied by a son or a son's son, and they co-exist
with a full or consanguine sister, the sister here will move from inheriting a
fixed portion to inheritance with _taʿṣīb_. Therefore, they take the balance
after the sharers, provided that there is no near male residuary heir who will
either share the inheritance with them or exclude them if he is nearer than them
to the deceased.

Uterine brothers and sisters are cognates. Like other collaterals they are also
secondary heirs and are, therefore, excluded by agnatic descendants and
ascendants. However, uterine brothers and uterine sisters are not excluded or
affected by full or consanguine brothers or sisters. Uterine brothers and
sisters take equal shares. Each one is entitled to !frac(1)(6) if alone.
However, when there are more than one uterine brother or sister, they take
!frac(1)(3) (the maximum for this class) with brothers and sisters sharing
equally. The rule of double share to male does not apply to this class.

a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in
a third, after payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so
that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from Allāh; and Allāh
is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing.)

### Agnatic heirs (ʿaṣabah or residuary heirs)

_ʿAṣabah_ are entitled to get the residue, if any, after the claims of the
sharers are settled. The proof is the following:

::: {custom-style="hadith AR"}
عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ ﷺ قَالَ «أَلْحِقُوا الْفَرَائِضَ بِأَهْلِهَا
فَمَا بَقِيَ فَهُوَ لأَوْلَى رَجُلٍ ذَكَرٍ.»
:::

::: {custom-style="hadith EN"}
Ibn ʿAbbās !p[themtwo] narrated that the Messenger of Allāh !pbuh said, «Give
the shares of inheritance to those who are entitled to them. As for what
remains, then it is for the closest male relative.»[@buk00, no. 6732]
:::

Residuary heirs or _ʿAṣabah_ can be classified into the following groups:

1. The male agnates in their own right (_ʿAṣabah bi Nafsihi_): this group
   includes son, father, brother, and paternal uncle. This is the most important
   class of _ʿAṣabah_ which will be discussed in detail in the following pages.

2. The four specified female agnates in the right of others (_ʿaṣabah bi
   ghayrihi_). They become agnates by virtue of others, they are:

   - Daughters in the presence of a son
   - Son's daughter in the presence of a son's son
   - Full sister in the presence of a full brother
   - Consanguine sisters in the presence of a consanguine brother.

   In these circumstances, these four inherit not as Quranic sharers but as
   agnates. However, a lower son cannot make a higher daughter a residuary heir.
   For example, if a person leaves F, M, D, SD, and SS as heirs.

3. The two specified female agnates with others (_ʿaṣabah bi ghayrihi_). This
   group comprises two female agnates of full sister and consanguine sister when
   they are heirs with daughter and/or son's daughter, provided they are not
   accompanied by a male agnate at their degree.

##### Male agnates (ʿaṣabah bi anfusihim) and the rules of priority among them

The fundamental principle of priority among _ʿaṣabah_ is that “the nearest must
take the whole residue.” This is based on the previously mentioned _ḥadīth_.

Identifying the closest or nearest relatives is decided on the bases of:

A. order
B. degree
C. strength of blood tie

##### Basis of order

On the basis of order the male agnates are divided into the following three
classes:

1. _Bunuwwah_ (Childship): These are the descendants of the deceased, i.e. sons,
   son's son, no matter how much he descends through males.

2. _Ubuwwah_ (Fatherhood): These are the ascendants of the deceased, i.e.
   father, father's father, no matter how much he ascends through males.

3. _Ukhūwwah_ (Brotherhood): These are the full and consanguine brothers and
   their male agnatic descendants no matter how much they descend through males.

4. _ʿUmūmah_ (Uncleship): These are the full and paternal uncles and their male agnatic
   descendants no matter how much they descend.

5. _Walāʾ_: This is for the ones who granted emancipation to the deceased and
   their _ʿaṣabah bi al-nafs_.

As a general rule, descendants exclude either completely or partially the other
four classes while ascendants exclude the collaterals. For example, a son's son
takes precedence over the father although the former is two degrees remote from
the deceased than the latter who is only one degree remote. Thus, son's son
excludes the father as a residuary heir. However, the father is still entitled
to his Quranic share of !frac(1)(6). Similarly, father excludes brothers, as
brothers belong to the third order, i.e. to the collaterals.

##### Basis of degree

If agnatic heirs belong to the same order, then the difference in degree of
closeness or nearness determines priority within a particular class. The
principle concerning this group is, _the nearer in degree excludes the more
remote_. On this basis son excludes all lower male agnatic descendants. For
instance, a son's son (SS) is excluded by a son (S). Similarly, a father
excludes other ascendants such as father's father (FF) and father's father's
father (FFF). Brother excludes nephews and an uncle excludes cousins.

##### Basis of strength of blood

The difference in blood strength may arise only in relation to the collaterals.
It is possible that the surviving heirs are equal in degree but are related to
the deceased differently. For instance, some are related to the deceased from
the mother's side only, others from the father's side only, and others who are
related to the deceased from both father's and mother's sides. Those who are
related to the deceased through both father's and mother's sides take priority
over those who are related only through the father's side. Full brothers and
uncles exclude corresponding consanguine relations. For instance, a full brother
excludes a consanguine brother although both are of equal degree of nearness to
the deceased. Uterine relations are an exception to this general rule and they
inherit simultaneously with full and consanguine blood relations.[@madina23, p.
74] A daughter, while getting her full share of !frac(1)(2), does not exclude a
son's daughter. Similarly, a full sister does not exclude a consanguine sister
or a consanguine brother after taking her specified share of !frac(1)(2).
However, in her capacity as a residuary heir, and not as a sharer, a full sister
gets precedence over consanguine brothers and sisters as distribution among
agnates is solely determined based on the rule, _the nearer in degree excludes
the more remote_.

The fundamental rule among _ʿaṣabah_ is that the nearest takes all. In each
category the nearer excludes the more remote. Where the priority can be
determined by applying the test of order, there is no need to look into the
degrees and blood strength of the claimant. Similarly, if preference could be
established on the basis of degree of nearness, there is no need to consider the
strength of their blood ties. For instance, a consanguine brother excludes the
full brother's son. Although the son of the full brother is collateral of higher
blood strength, he is lower in degree. Where _ʿaṣabah_ are of the same order,
same degree, and same blood strength, they share the residue equally among
themselves.

The application of these rules gives rise to the following principles:[For more
details on _Exclusion_, see @madina23, pp. 69--84]

1. In the presence of a son of the deceased, the grandsons, brothers, uncles,
   nephews, and cousins are completely excluded.

2. In the presence of a father of the deceased, the grandfathers, brothers,
   uncles, nephews, and cousins do not inherit.

3. Grandfather inherits along with full and consanguine siblings (except
   according to the Ḥanafīs) but excludes uncles and all other collaterals.

4. Brothers exclude nephews including sons of a predeceased brother.

5. Brothers and nephews exclude uncles and cousins.

6. Uncles exclude cousins including the sons of a predeceased uncle.

#### Doctrine of ʿawl (Increase)

If the shares allocated to the heirs are more than the common factor used to
divide the estate, their shares will be reduced proportionally. The process
whereby the shares are reduced is called the Doctrine of Increase (_ʿawl_) and
is done in the following ways:

1. Reduce the fractional share to a common denominator.

2. Increase the denominator so as to make it equal to the sum of numerators and
   allow the individual numerators to remain.

There are three numbers that accept _ʿawl_:

a. **Six (6):** and extends in the following sequence, to 7, 8, 9, 10.
b. **Twelve (12):** and extends in the following sequence, to 13, 15, 17.
c. **Twenty four (24):** and extends once to 27.

The following examples will illustrate the doctrine:

##### The extraction of the rule of ʿawl from the Quran

_ʿAwl_ literally means increase and technically it means an increase in the
lowest common denominator (LCM) and a decrease in the portions of the heirs.

The ruling of _ʿawl_ is also extracted from the Quran. The evidence for this is
that Allāh fixed for every heir his portion in inheritance. The heirs with
regard to inheritance are of two types: some are deprived from inheritance,
while others are not. In the case where some are deprived from inheritance, the
one who is deprived will not get anything. But in the cases where deprivation
did not take place, two situations might arise: a situation where the fixed
portion did not finish the whole estate, and a situation where the fixed
portions of the heirs finished and completed the whole estate of the deceased
which can happen in two ways: firstly, when the quantity of the portions did not
exceed the estate and secondly, when the quantity of the portions is higher than
the estate of the deceased. In this final situation we have two options: either
we take from the portions of other heirs to complete the deficiency of the share
of the other heirs or we give each and everyone their shares as much as possible
or according to our capability, in which case their heirs will just act like the
creditors who are owed money by the deceased and his estate cannot pay the debt
in full. We distribute in proportion to his wealth. There is no way to reach
this except through the means of _ʿawl_. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
Quran did not leave _ʿawl_ without an explanation.[@saadi02, Q4:11--2:, p. 181]
Allāh !swt knows best.[For more details on _ʿAwl_, see @madina23, pp. 112--7]

#### Doctrine of radd

If the shares allocated to the heirs are less than the common factor used to
divide the estate, and there is no agnate to take the residue, their shares will
be increased in proportion to their shares. The share of the spouse is subject
to reduction in the case of _ʿawl_, but he or she does not participate in _radd_
in the presence of any blood relation. But he or she takes the whole property,
in accordance with the Ḥanafīs, in the absence of all blood relations.!ref There
are some scholars of the opinion that the wife and husband should also be
included in the _radd_ because they are affected in _ʿawl_ so they should also
be included in benefitting in _radd_.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 49--50] The Shāfiʿīs
do not recognize the doctrine of return and argue that the residue should be
given to _bayt al-māl_.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 49--51]

The doctrine of _radd_ would apply in the following steps:

**First step:** Reduce the fractional shares to a common denominator.
Thus,

$$
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{6}
$$

**Second step:** Decrease the denominator to make it equal to the sum of the
numerators, and allow the individual numerators to remain.

Thus, !frac(1)(6) + !frac(3)(6) becomes !frac(1)(4) + !frac(3)(4), where 4 is
the sum of numerators 1 and 3. The shares are thus proportionately increased, so
that their sum becomes equal to unity (!frac(1)(4) + !frac(3)(4) = !frac(4)(4) =
1)

##### The extraction of the doctrine of return from the Quran

_Radd_ is the exact opposite of the method of _ʿawl_ where the decrease is in
the lowest common denominator and the increase is in the portions. This happens
when the fixed portion did not finish the whole estate of the deceased, and
there is no _ʿāṣib_ to take the remainder. The ruling according to the majority
is to take it back to _aṣḥāb al-furūḍ_ who inherited the deceased without
exception if the cause of their inheritance is _nasab_ (blood relationship).
This is based on the saying of Allāh !swt:

!quran(8_75-short)
(...وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡأَرۡحَامِ بَعۡضُهُمۡ أَوۡلَىٰ بِبَعۡضٖ فِي كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِۚ
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيۡءٍ عَلِيمُۢ ٧٥)
(...But kindred by blood are nearer to one another (regarding inheritance) in
the decree ordained by Allāh. Verily, Allāh is the All-Knower of everything.)
(!qlref(Anfāl)(8)(75))

This shows that the heirs who have this type of relationship are entitled to
_radd_. As for the husband and wife, they will not be included in _radd_ because
they are not related by blood and this is in accordance to the view of the
majority who excluded them from _radd_. On the contrary, there are some scholars
who believe that they should be equal to everyone just like how, when _ʿawl_
takes place, we reduce from their portions. Thus, when there is _radd_, they
should also be included in _radd_. The latter opinion is the closest to the
truth and the most logical opinion according to the Quran.[@saadi02, Q4:11--2,
pp. 181--2] Allāh !swt knows best.

#### Rules of exclusion

The rules governing the shares of heirs and the entitlement of other heirs are
modified by certain regulations and principles. These regulations which give
preference to some relations over others were developed by Muslim jurists. In
the absence of these regulatory rules, all relations -- close and remote --
would have claimed inheritance simultaneously. The main purpose of the rules of
exclusion (_ḥajb_) is to determine the relative priority and preference of an
heir based on their relationship with the deceased. It is by the application of
these rules that we can determine who among the many heirs are entitled to
inherit and who are not.[^note-exclusion]

[^note-exclusion]: [Note]{.smallcaps} The primary heirs -- i.e. son, daughter,
husband, wife, father, and mother -- are never excluded from inheritance. The
secondary heirs include son's daughter(s), grandfather, grandmother, and
collaterals. They sometimes inherit while at other times, may be either fully or
partially excluded by a primary heir.

Exclusion is of two types: Partial (imperfect) and Total (perfect).

##### Partial (imperfect) exclusion

1. When an heir is excluded from their original right and is allowed to have a
   different right. For example, the son excludes the daughter as a sharer and
   places her in the category of residuary heirs.

2. Where there is a partial reduction of the specific share due to the presence
   of certain heirs. For instance, the share of a spouse is reduced due to the
   presence of a child or an agnatic descendant.

##### Total (perfect) exclusion

It refers to a situation where a person, though entitled otherwise, is excluded
based on three principles.[For more details, see @madina23, pp. 72--6]

[principle I]{.smallcaps} “Nearer in degree excludes the more remote.” For
example, son excludes son's son, and father excludes grandfather.

[principle II]{.smallcaps} “Full blood excludes half blood brothers.” An
important exception is that uterine brothers or sisters are not excluded on this
ground.

[principle III]{.smallcaps} “A person who is related to the deceased through
another is excluded by the presence of the latter.” Two persons who are related
to each other through a third person cannot inherit from each other as long as
the third person is alive. Accordingly, brothers and sisters, and grandfather,
cannot inherit from each other in the presence of father. However, it does not
necessarily mean that if a father dies, the grandchildren would automatically
inherit from the grandfather. The grandchildren may still be excluded by their
uncles. Similarly, even if the father is dead, siblings may still be excluded to
inherit from each other if they have left sons. Siblings (full, consanguine, or
uterine) however, are not excluded by the mother.

#### Grandfather (GF)

A grandfather -- i.e. father's father -- can only inherit if the father is not
alive. The Quran and Sunnah have not mentioned the share of the grandfather when
he inherits with full or consanguine brothers and sisters of a deceased person.

<!-- TODO Add proper narration. Check Telegram. -->

On one occasion, ʿAli !p[him] was quoted to have said:

::: {custom-style="athar AR"}
من سَرَّهُ أن يقتحم جهنم فليقضي بين الجد و الإخوة
:::

::: {custom-style="athar EN"}
Whoever is happy to break into hellfire let him judge between a grandfather and brothers.
:::

Their refusal to give _fatwā_ in this case can be understood because it required
a serious _ijtihād_ (legal reasoning) which could differ one from another, Allāh
!swt pleasing or otherwise.

<!-- For this reason many Companions of the Prophet !pbuh used to refuse
to give their opinion about the grandfather's share, fearing to do injustice
either by giving more or less than each party was entitled to receive. -->

Nevertheless, the situation in Islamic inheritance demanded that legal rules for
the grandfather's case must be provided and systematized. Accordingly, early
Muslim jurists worked hard to provide a legal opinion on the grandfather's case
by looking into general teachings of the Quran, Sunnah, and different opinions
of Companions. The views can be summarized into two groups: the Ḥanafīs and most
of the other _madhabs_.

The Ḥanafīs adopted the opinion of Companions such as Abū Bakr, Ibn ʿAbbās, ʿAbd
Allāh bin al-Zubayr, and others !p[them] who viewed that a grandfather
substitutes a father and excludes all full and consanguine brothers and
sisters.[@mughni97, vol. 9, pp. 65--6] According to this view, verses of the
Quran which describe the share of a father should be applied to a grandfather.
Consequently, all siblings are excluded from inheritance by a grandfather.
However, the opponents of this view argue that even upon the death of the
grandfather, the full and consanguine siblings will still be excluded by the
children of the grandfather (paternal uncles and aunts of the full and
consanguine siblings).

In contrast to the Ḥanafīs, most _madhabs_ (i.e. Mālikīs, Shāfiʿīs, Ḥanbalīs,
Abū Yūsuf, and Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥassan al-Shaybānī) view that full and
consanguine siblings should inherit together with their grandfather.!ref The
argument of this group is that full and consanguine siblings are related to the
deceased in the same way as their grandfather in terms of degree. In other
words, the relationship of a grandfather with the deceased is through a father
which is exactly the case with the full and consanguine siblings. Besides,
giving preference to the grandfather by excluding full and consanguine siblings
would cause an injustice to the latters. The roots of this opinion go back to
the majority of Companions such as ʿAlī bin Abī Ṭālib, Ibn Masʿūd, and Zayd bin
Thābit (who was witnessed by Prophet !pbuhb himself to be the most knowledgeable
of the Companions in inheritance) and many others.!ref Therefore, because of the
balanced and just approach of this view, many Muslim countries adopted it in
their _Sharīʿah_ courts. Grandfather's cases with full and consanguine siblings
can be divided into two parts: (a) grandfather together with full and/or
consanguine siblings; (b) grandfather together with full and consanguine
siblings as well as with Quranic sharer(s).

**Part One**

There are two cases under this part:

**The first case** This is what is known as _al-muqāsamah_ which is sharing
whatever portion GF gets with the siblings. In this case GF will be acting like
one of the brothers, which means GF will take twice the portion of one sister.

*Formula* This is when the number of siblings inheriting with GF is less than
four. This can happen in only 5 situations: GF with either one sister, or two
sisters, or one brother, or one brother and one sister, or with three sisters.

!rawinc(.\tables\gtables.md)

**The second case** Grandfather takes the minimum $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total
estate.

*Formula* This is when the number of siblings is more than four. The examples of
this option are endless, e.g. GF with 3 brothers, or 2 brothers and one sister,
or 5 sisters, etc.

+-----+-----------+-----+------+

\ 

!note(If grandfather's case involves both full and consanguine siblings, the
rule would be that all of them should be counted without excluding consanguine
siblings as if they all are equally blood related. Upon allocation of
grandfather's share, normal rule of exclusion will be applied accordingly. In
other words, full brothers will exclude consanguine brothers and sisters after
grandfather's share is allotted. If grandfather's case involves only full
sisters and consanguine sisters, all should be counted as if they are equally
blood related. After the grandfather's minimum !frac(1)(3) is allotted, full
sisters will take their !frac(2)(3) which basically exhausts the whole estate.)

Consequently, no residue remains for consanguine sisters. If grandfather
inherits with full sister and consanguine siblings then the distribution will be
as illustrated in the following example:

<!-- FIXME “...in the following example:” -->

**Part Two**

Muslim jurists have agreed that Quranic sharers are always given priority over
others and that whenever grandfather and full or consanguine siblings inherit
together with any Quranic sharer, the grandfather should be given the best of
the following shares:

1. Sharing equally
2. !frac(1)(3) of the remainder
3. !frac(1)(6) of total

Obviously, finding out which of the above share is the best for the grandfather
will be possible only based on accurate calculation through comparison.

1. _al-Muqāsamah_

  *Formula:* This is when the remainder after the portions of the heirs is half
  of the estate or more, and the number of the siblings is less than four. Or
  the remainder after the portions of the heirs is less than !frac(1)(2) and
  more than !frac(1)(3) and the number of the siblings is two or less. Or what
  is left after the portions of the heirs is !frac(1)(3) and the number of the
  siblings is less than two. Some of its examples: GF with W and sister, or
  daughter and sister, or mother and brother, or husband and brother, or with
  wife, brother and sister, or wife, grandmother and three sisters, or with
  granddaughter, brother and sister, or with mother, wife, and brother.

<!-- Table: GF 9 -->

+-----+-----+
|     |  4  |
+=====+=====+
| W   | 1   |
+-----+-----+
| GF  | 2   |
+-----+-----+
| FS  | 1   |
+-----+-----+

\ 

<!-- Table: GF 10 -->

+-----+-----------+-----+
|     | 4 (× 5 =) | 20  |

| W   | 1         | 5   |
+-----+-----------+-----+
| GF  | 3         | 6   |
+-----+-----------+-----+
| FB  |           | 6   |
+-----+-----------+-----+
| FS  |           | 3   |
+-----+-----------+-----+


  In these cases the best portion for the grandfather will only be in sharing
  the remainder with brothers.

2. !frac(1)(3) of the remainder after the portions of the heirs is taken.

  *Formula:* This is when the remainder is more than half of the estate and the
  number of the siblings is more than four. Some of its examples: GF with three
  brothers and wife, or with two brothers, one sister, and mother, or with one
  brother, three sisters, and grandmother, or with five sisters and one wife, or
  with three brothers, three sisters, mother, and one wife.

<!-- Table: GF 11 -->

+-----+-----------+-----+
|     | 4 (× 3 =) | 12  |
+=====+===========+=====+
| W   | 1         | 3   |
+-----+-----------+-----+
| GF  | 1         | 3   |
+-----+-----------+-----+
| 3FB | 2         | 6   |
+-----+-----------+-----+

\ 

<!-- Table: GF 12 -->

+-----+------------+-----+
|     | 36 (× 3 =) | 108 |
+=====+============+=====+
| W   | 9          | 27  |
+-----+------------+-----+
| M   | 6          | 18  |
+-----+------------+-----+
| GF  | 7          | 21  |
+-----+------------+-----+
| 3FB | 14         | 42  |
+-----+------------+-----+

  In this example, we find that the shares are reduced in proportion based on
  doctrine of increase (_ʿawl_), therefore, no residue is left for full
  brothers.

3. !frac(1)(6) of the estate

  *Formula* This is when the remainder is less than half and more than
  !frac(1)(4) and the number of the siblings is more than two, or the remainder
  is only !frac(1)(4) and the number of the siblings is two or more or the
  remainder is less than !frac(1)(4). In this case, !frac(1)(6) is better for
  GF. Some of the examples include: GF with daughter, mother and a brother and a
  sister, or with granddaughter, wife and three sisters, or with daughter,
  husband and a brother, or with wife, two daughters, and one sister.

##### Exceptional case of al-Akdarīyyah

This case was named _al-Akdarīyyah_ (troubling) because of the woman who
troubled Zayd bin Thābit !p[him] for his view that left her without inheritance
while Quranic sharers and her grandfather got their respective shares. She
troubled him by opposing his opinion and convinced him to revise his view on her
case of inheritance because she was sure that the existing view needed some
adjustments. Upon revising her case, Zayd bin Thābit !p[him] found that indeed
her case was different from ordinary cases and therefore required him to provide
a unique solution in which he grouped her shares together with the shares of her
grandfather by giving her one portion and two portions to her grandfather after
deduction of Quranic shares.

Table: _Al-Akdarīyyah_: H, M, GF, and FS

+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+-----+------+
|     |     |  6  |  9  | 9 (× 3 =) | 27  | Each |
+=====+=====+=====+=====+===========+=====+======+
|     | H   | 3   | 3   | 3         | 9   |      |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+-----+------+
|     | M   | 2   | 2   | 2         | 6   |      |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+-----+------+
| 3   | GF  | 1   | 1   | 4         | 12  | 8    |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+-----+------+
|     | FS  | ?   | 3   |           |     | 4    |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+-----+------+

According to the rule, the FS cannot get a fixed portion when the GF is present;
she always has to share the remainder with him except in this case. This is
where there is H, M, GF, and FS or CS. It can be seen from the previous table
that the FS is given her fixed portion which is !frac(1)(2) of the estate.
Because of this, the least common multiple (LCM) is extended to 9 (through
_ʿawl_) after which the FS and GF combine what they both have. Then the GF acts
as a brother to take double the portion of one sister (_muqāsamah_). The reason
why it is called _akdarīyyah_ is because it destroyed the principles stated by
Zayd bin Thābit !p[him].!ref

!note(All _madhabs_ agree that the grandfather excludes uterine
siblings.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 33])

### Distant kindred (dhawī al-arḥām)

*Arḥām* is the plural of *raḥim*, which is interpreted to mean belonging to the
womb. It refers to maternal relations and cognates. Every blood relation of the
deceased who is not a sharer or a residuary heir is included in this class of
heirs.[@kuwait83, vol. 3, p. 53] Female agnates together with the cognates, both
male and female, comprise this class. The only exceptions are uterine brothers
and sisters and grandmothers who are sharers. This class may include children of
a daughter or children of a son's daughter, maternal grandfather, brother's
daughters, and paternal uncle's daughters. The Ḥanafīs, following some of the
Companions, hold the opinion that they should be given a share from the property
of the deceased. According to them distant kindred must get preference over
strangers, including _bayt al-Māl_. The Mālikīs and Shāfiʿīs follow the other
group of Companions that holds that no share shall be given to them. They are of
the opinion that any residue should go to the _bayt al-māl_.[@kuwait83, vol. 3,
pp. 45 and 53]

_Dhawī al-Arḥām_ are those relatives who are neither Quranic sharers nor
residuary heirs. According to the Ḥanafīs, _Dhawī al-Arḥām_ inherit when there
is no Quranic sharer or residuary heir. However, if only the husband or wife is
there, after giving them the fixed share Quran allotted to them, the residue
would go to _Dhawī al-Arḥām_. According to the Shāfiʿī _madhab_, the _bayt
al-māl_ has precedence over _Dhawī al-Arḥām_ provided it is well-managed and
functional. However, if there is no functional _bayt al-māl_ and there is no
Quranic sharer or residuary heir, the _Dhawī al-Arḥām_ are entitled to inherit.
The Shāfiʿīs and Mālikīs argue that the Quran has referred to the Quranic
sharers and residuary heirs but has not referred to _Dhawī al-Arḥām_ as heirs.
They also say that when the Prophet !pbuh was asked about the shares of the
father's sisters and mother's sisters, he replied that he was informed by Jibrīl
!s[him] that there were no shares for any of them.[@bayhaqi03, no. 12204]

The proponents, i.e. the Ḥanafīs and Ḥanbalīs, support their argument by quoting
the following _āyah_:

!quran(8_75-short)
(...وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡأَرۡحَامِ بَعۡضُهُمۡ أَوۡلَىٰ بِبَعۡضٖ فِي كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيۡءٍ عَلِيمُۢ ٧٥)
(...But kindred by blood are nearer to one another (regarding inheritance) in
the decree ordained by Allāh. Verily, Allāh is the All-Knower of everything.)
(Sūrah al-Anfāl, Q8:75)

According to them, the _āyah_ implies that, in the matter of inheritance, some
relations have preference over others. _Dhawī al-Arḥām_, as mentioned by the
Quran, covers all relatives whether they are sharers, agnates, or those whose
shares are not specified. They argue that the verse refers to them and their
rights are established. This entitlement, they argue, is not a new addition to
the Book of Allāh !swt. Besides this argument, they also rely on certain
traditions where a maternal uncle and a sister's son were given the estate by
the Prophet !pbuh.[@dawud97, no. 2899; ]!ref

#### Order of inheritance of dhawī al-arḥām

_Dhawī al-Arḥām_ are of four types and inherit in the following order:

1. Those who originated from the deceased such as daughter's children or son's
   daughter's children.

2. Those from whom the deceased has originated such as maternal grandfather or
   father's mother's mother.

3. Collaterals or those who originated from the deceased parents such as the
   children of sisters whether they are full, consanguine, or uterine and the
   daughters of brothers whether they are full, consanguine, or uterine.

4. Those who originate from the deceased's grandparents such as parental aunts,
   maternal uncles and maternal aunts, i.e. full, consanguine, or uterine
   sisters of the father, mother's brothers, and mother's sisters.

#### Example

The scholars who are of the view that _Dhawī al-Arḥām_ inherit are divided into
groups:

a. The view of _al-Qarābah_: This means that the closest among the _Dhawī
al-Arḥām_ in terms of order, degree, and strength of blood tie takes the whole
estate and excludes the most remote in terms of degree and strength of blood
tie.

b. The view of _al-Tanzīl_: This means that each one of the _Dhawī al-Arḥām_
inherits the share of the one who connected him to the deceased -- in other
words, replaces the one who connected him to the deceased. The following is an
illustration of the said controversy to ease its understanding:
